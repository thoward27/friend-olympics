      "gameplay": "How to play the boardgame chess\r\nChess is a classic two-player strategy game that's played on an 8x8 grid board. Here’s a quick guide on how to play:\r\n\r\nObjective\r\nThe goal is to checkmate your opponent's king, meaning the king is in a position to be captured (\"in check\") and there is no legal move to remove the threat.\r\n\r\nSetup\r\nBoard: Place the board so that each player has a white (or light) square on their right-hand side.\r\n\r\nPieces: Each player has 16 pieces: 1 King, 1 Queen, 2 Rooks, 2 Knights, 2 Bishops, and 8 Pawns.\r\n\r\nSetup: Arrange the pieces on the two rows closest to each player. From left to right on the first row: Rook, Knight, Bishop, Queen, King, Bishop, Knight, Rook. Place the pawns on the row in front of the other pieces.\r\n\r\nBasic Moves\r\nKing: Moves one square in any direction.\r\n\r\nQueen: Moves any number of squares in any direction.\r\n\r\nRook: Moves any number of squares horizontally or vertically.\r\n\r\nBishop: Moves any number of squares diagonally.\r\n\r\nKnight: Moves in an \"L\" shape: two squares in one direction and then one square perpendicular. Knights can jump over other pieces.\r\n\r\nPawn: Moves forward one square, or two squares on its first move. Pawns capture diagonally.\r\n\r\nSpecial Moves\r\nCastling: A special move involving the king and a rook. The king moves two squares towards the rook, and the rook moves next to the king. Conditions apply: neither piece can have moved before, there must be no pieces between them, and the king cannot be in check or move through check.\r\n\r\nEn Passant: If a pawn moves two squares forward from its starting position and lands beside an opponent's pawn, the opponent's pawn can capture it as if it had moved only one square forward.\r\n\r\nPawn Promotion: When a pawn reaches the opponent's back row, it can be promoted to any other piece (except a king), usually a queen.\r\n\r\nWinning the Game\r\nCheckmate: The game ends when a player's king is checkmated.\r\n\r\nStalemate: A draw occurs when a player has no legal moves and their king is not in check.\r\n\r\nOther Draws: The game can also end in a draw by mutual agreement, threefold repetition, fifty-move rule, or insufficient material to checkmate.",
